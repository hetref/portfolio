## Hey, I'm Aryan Shinde üëã

I‚Äôm a second‚Äëyear IT undergrad at M.G.M College of Engineering. I build modern web experiences that blend performance, aesthetics, and motion. I love shipping products, automating workflows, and designing interfaces that feel alive. When I‚Äôm not coding, you‚Äôll find me on a football field or sketching ideas to turn into real projects.

## About the Project
A visually rich, performant portfolio built with Next.js and Three.js. It features smooth scrolling, subtle micro‚Äëinteractions, immersive 3D scenes, and scroll‚Äëdriven storytelling.

### Live Demo
- Production: [aryanshinde.in](https://www.aryanshinde.in/)

---

## Features
- Smooth, inertial scroll with Lenis
- Hero with a realtime 3D computer model (R3F + Drei)
- Scroll‚Äërevealed ‚ÄúAbout Me‚Äù with GSAP mask transitions
- Horizontal pinned Work Experience timeline
- Projects with live link previews and animated entry
- Interactive 3D Earth on the contact section
- Contact form with Resend email delivery and a custom React Email template
- Responsive nav with animated show/hide and blur on scroll
- SEO metadata, OG/Twitter cards, and favicons

---

## Tech Stack
- Framework: Next.js 15, React 18
- 3D: Three.js, @react-three/fiber, @react-three/drei
- Animation: GSAP (ScrollTrigger, ScrollTo), Framer Motion
- Scrolling: @studio-freight/lenis
- Styling: Tailwind CSS, SCSS
- State: Zustand
- Email: Resend, React Email (@react-email/components)
- UI Utils: Radix Hover Card, clsx, tailwind-merge, react-icons, @tabler/icons-react

---

## How It Works (Implementation)

### Fonts, Metadata, and Global Shell
- `app/layout.js` loads Inter and Roboto via `next/font` with `display: 'swap'` and only the weights used.
- Comprehensive `metadata` includes Open Graph, Twitter, favicons, and a manifest.
- `GoogleAnalytics.jsx` injects analytics if `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_ANALYTICS` is set.
- `Preloader` + `AppContentGate` keep content hidden until initial 3D/model loading progresses.

### Smooth Scrolling
- `lib/LenisScroll.js` initializes Lenis, drives a `requestAnimationFrame` loop, and detects mobile via a store.

### Hero Section
- `components/Header.jsx`
  - Dynamic import of `Computers.jsx` (R3F Canvas) with a loading spinner.
  - `MorphingText` creates a threshold/blur morph effect between roles.
  - GSAP `ScrollToPlugin` provides smooth anchor navigation.

### 3D Models
- `components/Computers.jsx`
  - R3F `Canvas` tuned for perf: `dpr={[1,2]}`, `antialias: false`, `powerPreference: 'high-performance'`.
  - Handles WebGL context lost/restored and remounts the canvas for resilience.
  - `ModelComputer` preloads `/desktop_pc/scene.gltf`, sets lights, and scales for mobile.
- `components/Earth.jsx`
  - Preloads `/planet/scene.gltf`, renders a rotating earth with `OrbitControls`.

### About Me (Scroll‚ÄëMask Story)
- `components/MaskedAbout.jsx`
  - GSAP `ScrollTrigger` animates a circular mask growth and reveals paragraphs progressively.

### Skills
- `components/IKnow.jsx` pulls skill data from `constants/index.js` and animates progress bars with Framer Motion.

### Work Experience (Horizontal Scroll)
- `components/WorkExperience.jsx` uses a pinned horizontal scroll timeline with GSAP `ScrollTrigger`, responsive widths via `useResponsiveJSX`.

### Projects
- `components/MyProjects.jsx` renders animated cards, lazy images, and a `LinkPreview` hover card using Microlink screenshots (`qss` for URL params).

### Contact
- `components/ContactMe.jsx` composes a 3D earth alongside a form.
- `components/privateClientComponents/ContactForm.jsx` posts to `app/api/email/route.js` and shows toasts.
- `app/api/email/route.js` sends two emails via Resend: one to admin and one confirmation to the user using a custom React Email template (`components/emails/WelcomeTemplate.jsx`).

### Navigation
- `components/ui/resizable-navbar.jsx` + `components/Navbar.jsx` build a responsive, animated navbar that blurs/shrinks on scroll and hides on downward scroll.

### Business Pages
- Static T&C, Privacy, and Refund pages under `app/(business-pages)/` with consistent layout and return navigation.

---

## Optimization Principles
- Font performance: `next/font` with `display: 'swap'`, limited weights.
- Code splitting: dynamic imports for heavy 3D sections.
- Loading UX: `Preloader` overlay + `AppContentGate` visibility gate.
- 3D perf: no antialiasing, controlled `dpr`, `powerPreference: 'high-performance'`, minimal lights.
- Model preloading: `useGLTF.preload` for both desktop and earth models.
- Scroll perf: Lenis RAF loop, GSAP `scrub` animations to avoid layout thrash.
- Image perf: Next/Image, lazy loading, remote previews pre-warmed in a hidden image.
- State: lightweight global state with Zustand for loader and mobile flags only.
- Resilience: WebGL context lost/restored handling, guarded effects, and error boundaries.
- SEO: `metadataBase`, OG/Twitter images, and favicons.
